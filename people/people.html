		<h2>DR MICHAEL TOWSEY</h2>
		<p>Dr. Michael Towsey has held research positions at QUT since 1997. He uses machine learning methods to solve biological problems. These have ranged from the sublime (analysis of bird song) to the ridiculous (analysis of milk yield in cow herds) with some bioinformatics in between! Michael is currently in the Bioacoustics Research Group within the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at QUT. He works on the ‘big data’ problems associated with long duration recordings of the environment, in particular, building recognizers for species of interest, extracting acoustic indices to aid navigation and visualisation.</p>

		<h2>Mark Cottman-Fields</h2>
		<p>Mark Cottman-Fields is a PhD student. His research is titled Engaging Expert Birders to Analyse Environmental Bioacoustic Data. The recordings that the research group obtains from the field are used to prototype website interfaces for birders to listen and identify bird vocalisations. In order to extend birders’ physical activities online, allowing them to make use of existing expertise, his work includes investigating the established culture and practice of birders. This research will provide straight-forward and engaging online activities that build on and make use of physical experiences. The online tools produced form this work will support the creation of large-scale observational data for ecologists.</p>

		<div><img class="img_frame" alt="Phil" src="../images/phil.jpg" width="110" height="115" /></div>
		<h2>PHIL EICHINSKI</h2>
		<p>Combining automated and non-automated methods of acoustic analysis for bird species richness surveys. Phil's research will explore ways of using automated acoustic analysis to determine rich and diverse subsets of a long recording. This will speed up the process of a manual species richness survey conducted by a human, as they will need to listen to less audio to observe all the species present.</p>

		<h2>ANTHONY TRUSKINGER</h2>
		<p>Anthony Truskinger is a PhD student nearing the end of his candidature. His PhD, entitled Semi-Automated Annotation of Environmental Acoustic Recordings, is focused on assisting the citizen scientists that contribute useful information in online bioacoustic analysis environments. Anthony is also a research assistant working for the bioacoustics research group. He supports other researchers within the group by managing data, running large scale analyses on large compute resources, and by developing professional bioacoustic analysis software for the web.</p>
